# Awareness of Waste Recycling

#### The world generates at least 3.5 million tons of waste per day and this number is still increasing day by day that's why we need to aware about waste.
#### This web application can classify waste with 9 different waste materials and it will show you the details of that particular waste materials. This will help to raise awareness for people to reduce and recycle waste.
#### Also we save your classified waste in database to implement it in real time by integrating IOT in machine learning model
  
### Contribute on this project, Any type of contributions is highly appreciated

Overview

- There are **LIGHT BLUBS, PAPER, PLASTIC, ORGANIC, GLASS, BATTERIES, CLOTHES, METAL, E-WASTE** total 9 different types of waste materials which are use for recycling.
- In this project i have collected and filtered data by my self from google images and dreamstime.com
- Here i have **8369 images** belonging **9 classes**.
- Here i have trained dataset using **VGG16** Transfer Learning technique of CNN for classification.
- Here i have trained this model till **28 epochs** and i got **69.77%** accuracy.
- Initially i had trained my model with **Inceptionv3** and it's gave me **90.34%** accuracy. But it was not accurate when i tested it on some images. But when i tested **VGG16** with **69.77%** accuracy it gives me accurate result.
